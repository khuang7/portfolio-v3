## ðŸš€ Project Structure

This projects was built with Astro and TailwindCss. Astro is pretty neat, and a nice way to make nice performant static websites like mine. The cool thing about Astro is that there is an automatic tailwind and react integration which made my life super easy


## ðŸ§ž Commands to run this locally

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal via `yarn run dev` and `yarn run build` to make a production build.
