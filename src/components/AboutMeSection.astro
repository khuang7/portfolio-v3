        👋 Hello! I'm a software developer and UNSW Computer Science graduate
        with a passion for building modern web and mobile applications.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I specialize in front-end development using TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS,
        and Next.js, with experience building cross-platform iOS and Android applications.
        I have worked with DevOps tools like Webpack, write automation scripts with Python,
        and handle CI/CD deployments with a focus on test-driven development. I've also
        worked extensively with IoT firmware development using OpenWRT and Lua.  
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Always eager to learn and explore new technologies, I'm excited to take on
        new challenges and fly to the moon wherever I work 🌙🚀

  <Card title="Beyond Code">
    <div class="font-medium text-lg">
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, you'll find me on the tennis or pickleball court,
        playing CS2, or tinkering with Raspberry Pi projects like Pi-hole,
        e-ink displays, and home assistant set ups. I also love travelling
        and exploring new places around the world. 🌏
