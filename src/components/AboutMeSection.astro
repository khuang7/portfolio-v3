      <p>
        👋 Hello! I'm a software developer and UNSW Computer Science graduate
        with a passion for building modern web and mobile applications.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I specialize in front-end development using TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS,
        and Next.js, with experience building cross-platform iOS and Android applications.
        I work with DevOps tools like Webpack, write automation scripts with Python,
        and handle CI/CD deployments with a focus on test-driven development. I've also
        worked extensively with IoT firmware development using OpenWRT and Lua, and built
        serverless applications with Cloudflare Workers.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Always eager to learn and explore new technologies, I'm excited to take on
        new challenges and fly to the moon wherever I work 🌙🚀
