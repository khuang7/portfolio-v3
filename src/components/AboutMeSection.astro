        ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm a software developer and UNSW computer science graduate
        with a passion for emerging web technologies.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        At present, I specialize in front-end technologies using TypeScript,
        React, TailwindCSS, and NextJS. I've also had the pleasure of engaging
        with DevOps tools like Webpack, as well as writing scripts for CI/CD
        deployments and engaging in TDD. Additionally, I've crafted internal
        scripts to enhance an IoT product and explored open-source OpenWRT tools
        for Wi-Fi configuration.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Enthusiastic about learning more things in the tech realm, I eagerly
        anticipate the opportunity to fly to the moon wherever I work ðŸŒ™ðŸš€
